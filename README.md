<h1 align="center">🎮 Fede-ai - Controller 🎮</h1>

<h3>Project overview 🗺️ :</h3>

- This C++ project allows you to control another Windows computer wirelessly
- It works using TCP sockets and a running server is needed to establish the connection
- The project consists of three applications:
  - A "Victim" app that has to be opened on a computer for it to be controlled
  - A "Controller app that lets you see the list of "Victim"s connected to the server and choose one of them to control
  - The server that makes the connection possible
- The "Victim" application is almost invisible to the user and automatically runs on startup

 <h3>Libraries needed 📖 :</h3>

 - This project relies on two different libraries:
   - My personal library (you can download the source files from https://github.com/Fede-ai/My-library)
   - SFML version 2.6.0 (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.0/)
 - For convenience, both libraries' paths are set to C:/. You can change this in the settings
